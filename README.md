# Introduction

Have you ever met any problem in visualizing sea of multi-level network data like cloud service device network or complex category data even biology network which is structured hierarchically?

Good news! Maybe you can try this intelligent partition layout. Primarily, **cut up the finite display zone hierarchically and weightedly.** Then, **lay the specific nodes within their corresponding polygon boundary firmly and strictly**. Finally, here comes an transparent and interactive graph!

# Main Usage and Interactions

1. **Relation Analysis**: Click the node you are interested in, then the global related nodes, edges and their corresponding polygon areas are highlighted.
2. **Eye-catching Interactions**: Zooming, pinning, dragging (Of course, **nodes is undoubtly limited in the polygons regardless of initial layout or dragging stage!** ) and **search by ip or partition name.**
3. **Prominent Concerning Area**: Special and vital level are place in the center of its father level maximally in order to show the overall relationships
4. **Feture Distribution**: These charts helps us grasp the fundamental distribution of data characteristics.
